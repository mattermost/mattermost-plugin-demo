# Demo Plugin: Server

The server component of this demo plugin is written in Go and [net/rpc](https://golang.org/pkg/net/rpc/). It relies on [configuration](#plugin-settings) in [plugin.json](../plugin.json) to implement each of the supported hooks.

Each of the included files or folders is outlined below.

## [go.mod](go.mod), [go.sum](go.sum)

These are metadata files managed by [vgo](https://github.com/golang/vgo) for dependency management. While vgo is currently in beta, it will launch as part of the standard Go 1.11 tooling and stabilize in subsequent releases. It was preferred for this project over [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep) since it does not require locating your plugin in the `$GOPATH`.

## [main.go](main.go)

This is the entry point of your plugin binary, that in turn invokes [plugin.ClientMain](https://godoc.org/github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/plugin#ClientMain) to wire up RPC communication between your plugin and the Mattermost Server.

## [plugin\_id.go](plugin_id.go)

This is a file generated by the [build/manifest](../build/manifest) tool that captures the plugin id from [plugin.json](../plugin.json). It simplifies the need to hard-code the plugin id in multiple places by exporting a constant for use instead.

## [plugin.go](plugin.go)

This file defines the `Plugin` struct, embedding [plugin.MattermostPlugin](https://godoc.org/github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/plugin#MattermostPlugin) to automatically handle the wiring up the [API](https://godoc.org/github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/plugin#API) when the plugin starts. It contains public fields that are automatically unmarshalled from [plugin.json](../plugin.json) as part of the `OnConfiguration` hook in [configuration.go](configuration.go).

## [activate\_hooks.go](activate_hooks.go)

### OnActivate

This demo implementation logs a message to the demo channel whenever the plugin is activated.

### OnDeactivate

This demo implementation logs a message to the demo channel whenever the plugin is deactivated.

## [configuration.go](configuration.go)

### OnConfigurationChange

This demo implementation ensures the configured demo user and channel are created for use
by the plugin. Also, if a configuration change is detected then the plugin will log a message
to the demo channel with the updated configuration values.

## [channel\_hooks.go](channel_hooks.go)

### ChannelHasBeenCreated

This demo implementation logs a message to the demo channel whenever a channel is created.

### UserHasJoinedChannel

This demo implementation logs a message to the demo channel whenever a user joins a channel.

### UserHasLeftChannel

This demo implementation logs a message to the demo channel whenever a user leaves a channel.

## [command\_hooks.go](command_hooks.go)

### ExecuteCommand

This demo implementation responds to a `/demo_plugin` command, allowing the user to enable
or disable the demo plugin's hooks functionality (but leave the command and webapp enabled).

## [http\_hooks.go](http_hooks.go)

### ServeHTTP

This demo implementation sends back whether or not the plugin hooks are currently enabled. It
is used by the web app to recover from a network reconnection and synchronize the state of the
plugin's hooks.

## [message\_hooks.go](message_hooks.go)

### MessageWillBePosted

This demo implementation rejects posts in the demo channel, as well as posts that @-mention
the demo plugin user.

### MessageWillBeUpdated

This demo implementation rejects posts that @-mention the demo plugin user.

### MessageHasBeenPosted

This demo implementation logs a message to the demo channel whenever a message is posted,
unless by the demo plugin user itself.

### MessageHasBeenUpdated

This demo implementation logs a message to the demo channel whenever a message is updated,
unless by the demo plugin user itself.

## [team\_hooks.go](team_hooks.go)

### UserHasJoinedTeam

This demo implementation logs a message to the demo channel in the team whenever a user
joins the team.

### UserHasLeftTeam

This demo implementation logs a message to the demo channel in the team whenever a user
leaves the team.

## [login\_hooks.go](login_hooks.go)

### UserWillLogIn

This demo implementation rejects login attempts by the demo user.

### UserHasLoggedIn

This demo implementation logs a message to the demo channel whenever a user logs in.

## [user\_hooks.go](user_hooks.go)

### UserHasBeenCreated

This demo implementation logs a message to demo channel whenever a new user is created.

## [file\_hooks.go](file_hooks.go)

### FileWillBeUploaded

This demo implementation logs a message to demo channel whenever a file is uploaded.


## Plugin Settings

The following settings are available in the demo plugin system console page to demonstrate what is available via the [Mattermost Plugin Settings Schema](https://developers.mattermost.com/extend/plugins/manifest-reference/#settings_schema).

![system-console-demo-settings](docs/demo-settings.png)

### Channel Name

A `text` setting type to define the channel that the demo plugin will create and use to post messages.

### Username

A `text` setting type to define the username value that will be given to the demo user.

### Demo User Last Name

A `radio` setting type to define the last name value that will be given to the demo user.

### Text Style

A `dropdown` setting type that changes the text style of messages posted by the demo plugin. Options include italics and bold.

##### Note: this setting doesn't apply to `OnConfigurationChange` log messages.

### Random Secret

A `generated` setting type for a random string that can be generated in the demo plugin settings page of the system console. The demo plugin will look for this value in any message posted and will paste the [secret message](#secret-message) to the demo channel when it is found.

### Secret Message

A `longtext` setting type to define the message that is posted to the demo channel when the [random secret](#random-secret) is posted.

### Enable Mention User

A `bool` setting type to control whether the [mention user](#mention-user) is tagged(@'ed) on all demo plugin messages.

##### Note: this setting doesn't apply to `OnConfigurationChange` log messages.

### Mention User

A `username` setting type to define the user that will be tagged(@'ed) on all demo plugin messages.

##### Note: this setting doesn't apply to `OnConfigurationChange` log messages.
